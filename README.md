Files for the article ''A Boundary Corrected Complex Convolution Framelet for Block Segmented Signals''

The .py scripts , pr.py and spectrograms.py are meant to be run. pr.py tests the perfect reconstruction of the convolution framelet on Example.wav. The script outputs a plot of the reconstruction error and prints True if the reconstruction error is sufficiently small.
spectrograms.py plots the spectrograms of Exmaple.wav seen in the article. The script also outputs the audio files clean.wav, synth.wav and circ.wav. A custom wav file can be used by editing the file_name in line 12.
